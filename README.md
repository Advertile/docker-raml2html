# docker-raml2html

This is a simple [node:6](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/) based docker image which we installed the [raml2html/raml2html](https://github.com/raml2html/raml2html) and then we generate the HTML on a hardcoded RAML file.

If you want to use this, have a `api.raml` file in the context directory where you run the image. Then a api.html file will be generated.
